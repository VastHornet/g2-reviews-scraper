## ❓ FAQ

**Q: How do I get started?**
Sign up at [apify.com](https://www.apify.com/?fpr=2ayu9b), grab your API token from Settings → Integrations, and run the actor via the Apify console, API, Python SDK, or any integration (Zapier, Make.com, n8n).

**Q: What's the typical cost per run?**
See the pricing section below. Most runs finish under $0.10 for typical batches.

**Q: Is this actor maintained?**
Yes. NexGenData maintains 165+ Apify actors and ships updates regularly. Bug reports via the Apify console issues tab get responses within 24 hours.

**Q: Can I use the output commercially?**
Yes — you own the output data. Check the target site's Terms of Service for any usage restrictions on the scraped content itself.

**Q: How do I handle rate limits?**
Apify manages concurrency and retries automatically. For very large batches (10K+ items), run multiple smaller jobs in parallel instead of one mega-job for better reliability.
